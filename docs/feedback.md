# Feedback & Adaptation Logic

Feedback sources:
- Explicit rating (1-5)
- Edit-based feedback (diffs from user edits)
- Implicit signals (reuse, acceptance, continuation)

Adaptation flow:
1. Score feedback into preference deltas.
2. Update creative memory weights.
3. Rebalance originality vs consistency slider default.
4. Increase cultural alignment sensitivity if flagged.
